**Author: iorp (GitHub username)**

---

## Overview

*hex-map* serves as a draft for a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed in Unity, focusing on tactical deployment on a hexagonal grid. It provides a framework for exploring the scenario and mechanics of the game, allowing for experimentation and iteration before finalizing the game.

## Features

1. **Hexagonal Grid:** The draft utilizes a hexagonal grid system for movement and positioning of entities, providing a foundation for strategic placement and maneuvering in real-time battles.
   
2. **Dynamic Erosion:** Environmental erosion mechanics dynamically alter the terrain over time, affecting movement, line of sight, and tactical opportunities. Adapt your strategy as the landscape changes.

3. **Terrain Effects:** Different terrain types such as forests, mountains, and rivers impact unit movement speed, visibility, and combat effectiveness, adding depth to strategic decision-making.

4. **Real-Time Combat:** Engage in fast-paced battles where players must think quickly and adapt their tactics on the fly to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents.

5. **Deployment Phase:** Prior to battles, players strategize their initial deployment, positioning their forces strategically on the battlefield to gain an advantage over their adversaries.

6. **Customization:** Customize your army composition and upgrade your units to fit your preferred playstyle and adapt to changing battlefield conditions.

7. **Singleplayer and Multiplayer Modes:** Immerse yourself in challenging singleplayer campaigns or test your skills against friends or other players in competitive multiplayer battles.
